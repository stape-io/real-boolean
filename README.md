# Real Boolean Variable for Google Tag Manager Server Container

The **Real Boolean Variable** for Google Tag Manager Server Container allows you to return a strictly typed boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on a selected option, avoiding common type coercion issues (i.e. returning as a string instead of a boolean).

## Getting Started

1. Add the **Real Boolean Variable** to your GTM Server container.
2. Choose whether the variable should return `true` or `false` by selecting the desired option in the template settings.
